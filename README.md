This repository was created with the purpose of showcasing some algorithm structures and what they are actually used for, in terms of Time Complexity.

# Sorting Algorithms
Demonstrating the implementation and usage of two fundamental sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Quick Sort. These algorithms serve as classic examples of sorting techniques, each with its own unique approach to ordering elements within an array.

# Bubble Sort:
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the entire list is sorted. While Bubble Sort is not the most efficient algorithm for large datasets, it is a fundamental concept to understand and serves as a good starting point for learning about sorting algorithms.

# How Bubble Sort Works:
Compare adjacent elements in the array.
Swap them if they are in the wrong order.
Repeat the process until the entire array is sorted.

# Quick Sort:
Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. Quick Sort's average-case time complexity makes it a popular choice for sorting large datasets.

# How Quick Sort Works:
Choose a 'pivot' element from the array.
Partition the other elements into two sub-arrays: elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot.
Recursively sort the sub-arrays and concatenate them around the pivot.

# Usage:
Feel free to explore the provided code examples and try out different input arrays to see how these sorting algorithms function in action. Understanding the mechanics of Bubble Sort and Quick Sort can provide valuable insights into fundamental sorting concepts and prepare you for more advanced sorting algorithms.
